# Code Review

This repository contains a Python code that can help you review your code under the open-source MIT license. The code review process is an essential part of software development, as it helps identify bugs, improve code quality, and ensure adherence to best practices.

## Features

The code review tool provides the following features:

1. **Automated Review**: The tool performs automated code review by analyzing your Python code and providing feedback on potential issues, such as syntax errors, code smells, and performance bottlenecks.

2. **Static Analysis**: It utilizes static code analysis techniques to identify common coding mistakes, such as unused variables, unreachable code, and potential security vulnerabilities.

3. **Code Metrics**: The tool calculates various code metrics, including cyclomatic complexity, code duplication, and code coverage, to assess the overall quality and maintainability of your code.

4. **Documentation Check**: It verifies the presence of proper documentation, such as function and class docstrings, to ensure that your code is well-documented and easy to understand.

5. **Style Guide Enforcement**: The tool enforces adherence to a specific coding style guide, such as PEP 8, by checking for violations and suggesting appropriate style improvements.

6. **Integration with Version Control**: It seamlessly integrates with popular version control systems, such as Git, allowing you to review code changes and provide feedback directly within the repository.
